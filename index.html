          Most of my <a href="about.html">work experience</a> is in the education field, but I'm currently learning HTML + CSS at <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/">The Starter League</a> to see where it takes me.  <br> Learning something new is always exciting, so I started writing a <a href="journal.html">blog</a> about my journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br> When I'm not at work or learning technology, you will find me at home with my newly expanded family that means the world to me!
